# Face-Detection
Face - Detection Mini Project

This mini project demonstrates the implementation of face detection using Haar cascade in Python. The Haar cascade is a machine learning object detection algorithm used to identify objects in images or video streams. In this case, we will be using it to detect human faces in images.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

1. Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. OpenCV library (https://opencv.org/)
3. Haarcascade XML file for face detection (included in this repository)


Customization
You can customize the behavior of the face detection algorithm by modifying the parameters in the .ipynb script. For example, you can adjust the minimum and maximum size of the detected faces, or change the scale factor used during the detection process. Feel free to experiment and find the settings that work best for your specific use case.
